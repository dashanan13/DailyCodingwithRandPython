    "Decorators are an important subject in Python. \n",
    "They're part of a larger subject called meta programming. \n",
    "Decorators are functions that take your function as an input. \n",
    "The idea is to encode reusable functionality as decorator functions and then decorate other functions with it. \n",
    "The purpose is to give your function a feature it didn't have before. \n",
    "A decorator can, for example, add fields to your object, measure the time it takes to invocate a function, and do much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of OOP and getters and setters, a specific decorator @property can help you remove some boilerplate code when you add getters and setters. \n",
    "The @property decorator does the following things for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "Creates a backing field: When you decorate a function with the @property decorator, it creates a backing private field. \n",
    "You can override this behavior if you want, but it's nice to have a default behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifies a setter: A setter method can change the backing field.\n",
    "Identifies a getter: This function should return the backing field.\n",
    "Identifies a delete function: This function can delete the field.\n",
    "Let's see this decorator in action:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the preceding code, the function height() is decorated by the decorator @property. \n",
    "This decoration action creates the private field __height. \n",
    "The __height field isn't defined in the constructor __init__() because the decorator does that already. \n",
    "There's also another decoration happening, namely, @height.setter. \n",
    "This decoration points out a similar-looking height() method as the setter. \n",
    "The new height method takes an another parameter value as its second parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to manipulate the height separate from the width will still cause a problem. \n",
    "You'll need to understand what the class does before you consider allowing getters and setters, because you're introducing risk."
